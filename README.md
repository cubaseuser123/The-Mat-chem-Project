# The-Mat-chem-Project
This is a project that I created during my 12th grade along with my fellow group members, Its a simple, python-rookie code that lets you perform multiple functions over subjects such as Mathematics and Chemistry, Its a very basic code that used loops and functions. But it does its job!
