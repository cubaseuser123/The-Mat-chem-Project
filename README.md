# The-Mat-chem-Project
This is a project that I created during my 12th grade along with my fellow group members, Its a simple, python-rookie code that lets you perform multiple functions over subjects such as Mathematics and Chemistry such as getting to know about certain information of an element (atomic mass, electronic configuration and much more...) and also contaions a reaction balancer tool. With Mathemtics it includes a basic caluclator, a trignometric calculator and a complete log table. Its a very basic code and i compiled all its sections into one file and it uses basic concepts of python such as loops and functions. But it does its job!

PS: Before you run this project please install these following 3rd-Party libraries using Windows Command Promt (in administrator mode):
